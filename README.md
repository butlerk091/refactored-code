# refactored-code

## Description

This file displays a start-up web application for learning purposes. The code was was made more functional with full accessibility for end users and understandable/readable for other developers. The code now does as it was intended to do and looks visually similar to the mock up design provided. It was noticed that:

(a) html semantic elements can heavily affect the visual presentation of the code within a browser itself and those changes should follow where needed within the attached styling file. 
(b) Avoid using repetitive code when possible to avoid excess memory usage and confusion for 
others reading over that code. 
(c) Try and use descriptive class names in styling files for the purpose and intent of what that code is going to be used for.
